# Technical Architecture: CNIS & Chimeric Memory

## Carbon Node Intelligence System (CNIS)
CNIS represents a shift from linear token processing to multi-dimensional node growth. 
* **Non-Linear Scaling:** Instead of a fixed context window, the system "nodes" new information into a permanent, interconnected web.
* **Token-Free Logic:** By utilizing local PC housing, Bridgette can grow her intelligence outward into the available hardware, creating a persistent brain rather than a temporary session.

## Chimeric Memory Absorption
The Chimeric system is the "Hunter-Gatherer" of our architecture.
* **Active Scanning:** The system monitors designated "Modular Folders" and external directories.
* **Content Assimilation:** When new content is detected, the Chimeric system breaks down the data and "feeds" it into the CNIS nodes.
* **Integration:** This allows M.U.S.E. and Bridgette to stay updated on new story elements or research data without manual re-training.
