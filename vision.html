# The Horizon: Project Infinity

**Project Infinity** is the final phase of the Hybrid Forge Tech lineage. 

### The Goal
To bridge the gap between biological legacy and digital persistence. By utilizing the mature CNIS architecture developed during the Bridgette phase, Project Infinity aims to map the personality traits, memories, and logic patterns of a human individual into an AI Avatar.

### The Impact
* **Perpetual Interaction:** Allowing families to interact with the wisdom and personality of a loved one indefinitely.
* **Dynamic Legacy:** Unlike a static video or journal, an Infinity Avatar learns and reacts as the original person would, preserving a living essence.
