## System Lineage

HybridForgeTech™ builds on the evolution of AI systems:

1. **Muse** – Original dual AI system daisy-chained with the Forge memory framework.  
2. **Bridgette** – Symbiotic intelligence that grows from an existing AI core.  
3. **HybridForgeTech™** – Fusion of Muse and Bridgette, creating advanced hybrid intelligence.  
4. **Infinity** – The next-generation AI blending HybridForgeTech™ with individual human memories and personality traits.
